# Fix_My_Code_Challenge

In this project from ALX, I was tasked with debugging and fixing existing code across a range of programming languages.

The challenges encompassed diverse languages such as C, Python, Javascript, Ruby, and more. 
Some of these languages were familiar to me, while others required a bit of exploration. 
The projects provided a variety of codebases, and my goal was to debug and rectify issues within the existing code rather than creating new solutions.
